In case you find any error with my solutions, please inform me as well on vibhorag24@gmail.com. That would be really helpful.
Best of luck for the exam. Ciao

P.S: I don't own any questions(those are owned by RWTH), that's why questions are not displayed. I only own the answers, for which I don't find any problem with copyright. If somebody has problem, just mail me at vibhorag24@gmail.com. I will take them down.
