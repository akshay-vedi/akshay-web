I am a Master's student, studying Automotive Engineering at [RWTH Aachen](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I graduated in 2017 with a major and minor degree in Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mathematics, from [Indian Institute of Technology,Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in). Currently I am working as a [Student research assistant](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wissenschaftliche_Hilfskraft) on Sensor fusion for Navigation and path planning of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle with [Galileo group](http://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/IRT/Forschung/~izql/Galileo/?lidx=1) at [Institute of Automatic Control](http://www.irt.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~iung/IRT/lidx/1/), [RWTH Aachen](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~a/root/?lidx=1). I have worked on the design and dynamics of Automotive vehicles at [IITK Motosports](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ame/sae/), Humanoid Robots at [Italian Institute of Technology, Genova](https://www.iit.it) and material handling robots for warehouse at [Grey Orange Robotics](www.greyorange.com). To know more about me, you can see my detailed Curriculum Vitae [here](https://vibhoraggarwal.github.io/files/CV.pdf) or short resume [here](https://vibhoraggarwal.github.io/files/VibhorResume_en.pdf)

When I am not working I am reading or hearing books, learning languages on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/vibhorag), running or hiking outdoors, or simply meeting my friends.
